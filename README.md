Translator
==========

This plugin will use an API in order to translate chat messages into your locale language. Not all languages will be supported; however, there should be enough to cover the majority.

Translated messages will appear in italics and when you hover over the message it will show the original language and message.

In the future, you will be able to toggle wether you want the auto-translation feature.

If the API takes too long to respond, the message will be strikedthrough and will notify the user that the string is not able to be translated.
